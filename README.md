# The client and their software requirements:

Our client The Gaming Room wishes to build a web-based game that works on multiple platforms grounded on their current game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is currently available in the Android app only. There will be multiple teams involving several players competing in four rounds of play that take one minute each. Game and team names must be unique to let players check whether a name is in use when selecting a name for the team. The app will extract images at a constant rate from a large collection of stock drawings as clues within 30 seconds. The team must guess the puzzle before time ends, or else, the other teams get a chance to submit one guess each to work out the puzzle with a 15-second time constraint. Only one instance of the game can be present in memory at any given time. I.e., have unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

# What did I do particularly well in developing this documentation:

I believe I did particularly well in evaluating characteristics,  advantages, disadvantages, and deployment within the documentation relating to the client side. With the help of course material, I was able to compare the Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile device platforms effectively. 

# The process of working through a design document and its usefulness when developing the code.

A carefully written design document gives a clear understanding of the project's goals and objectives, and hence developers can ensure that their work aligns with the overall project vision. It is usually created by a team of people, including stakeholders, designers, and developers guaranteeing that everyone is on the same page and that each team member knows their role in the project. Hence the coding phase will be more efficient. Since the design document outlines the scope of the project and includes its features and functionality, by working through the design document, developers can better plan the project, breaking it down into smaller, more adaptable tasks. So, the project will stay on track and deadlines will be met. It can also help developers recognize potential difficulties and tackle them before they become critical issues during development.

# What part of the document I would like to revise:

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would pick the evaluation related to client and development tools. I think that section can be expanded with rich details comparing Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile device platforms analytically.

# How I interpreted the user’s needs and implement them into the software design and why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing:

To understand the user's needs, it is vital to conduct user research via surveys, interviews, and usability testing. This gives an understanding of the user's preferences, expectations, and concerns. Then I prioritize needs and requirements based on their importance to the user. I then create prototypes of the software design and conduct user testing to collect feedback and validate the design. Based on the feedback received from user testing, I finally refine the software design to advance usability.

Considering the user’s needs when designing leads to increased productivity, efficiency, user satisfaction, and a higher likelihood of repeat use. Clients are then more likely to recommend it to others, leading to more adoption and revenue for the business. When software is designed with the user's needs in mind, it is less probable to need support or troubleshooting. This means reduced support costs for the business.

# How did I approach designing software and what techniques or strategies I will use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application:

I approached designing software by first analyzing the client's constraints and exploring possible systems to implement. Next, I assessed cost, security measures, operating systems architecture, memory management, and storage management. Analyzing all the above I concluded the recommendations for the considered implementations. 

The techniques and strategies that I will use to analyze and design a similar software application in the future include requirement gathering, case analysis, interphase design, agile development, prototyping, testing, and continuous upgrading. This will ensure that I design software that meets the requirements of end-users and stakeholders and hence is thriving in the market.
